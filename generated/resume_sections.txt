Face Rekognition
This project is built using deep leaning layers which reads image from
web page using live camera and captures the image and detect the
JNTU number of the student. It is also built using AWS boto/three.tf module
and Flask to display JNTU number on web page.
Digit Recognisation
It is a simple linear regression model which takes input as image and
detect the number.
Face Mask Detection
It is built using deep learning layers which reads image of the person
and detects whether the person is wearing mask or not.
